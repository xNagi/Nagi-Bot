# Nagi-Bot

Nagi is my first Discord Music bot, trying to implement and learn js.

<pre>
Framework: Node.js
</pre>            

<pre>
Modules: discord-music-player (npm install discord-music-player), 
         discord.js (npm install discord.js),
         opusscript (npm install opusscript)
</pre>

<pre>
Commands available: Play/Queue,
                    Playlist,
                    Stop,
                    Skip,
                    Shuffle
</pre>            
                    
That's my first real project to learn more programming. Feel free to used it.

NOTE: It actually needs a config.js file to work, where you need to put your dev Discord token and your bot prefix.

It should be like this:
<pre>
<code>{
    "token": "yourtoken",
    "prefix": "yourprefix",
}</code>
</pre>
