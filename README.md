# Nagi-Bot

Nagi is my first Discord Music bot, trying to implement and learn js.

Framework: Node.js
Modules: **discord-music-player** (npm install discord-music-player), 
          **discord.js** (npm install discord.js),
          **opusscript** (npm install opusscript)

Commands available: **Play/Queue**,
                     **Playlist**,
                     **Stop**,
                     **Skip**,
                     **Shuffle**.
                    
                    
That's my first real project to learn more programming. Feel free to used it.

NOTE: It actually needs a config.js file to work, where you need to put your dev Discord token and your bot prefix.

It should be like this:
<pre>
<code>{
    "token": "yourtoken",
    "prefix": "yourprefix",
}</code>
</pre>
